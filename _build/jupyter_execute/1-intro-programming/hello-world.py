# Hello World

In this section, I want to introduce the basics of programming. While the following subsections are relatively straightforward, I guarantee that you will be using everything in here throughout your data science journey!

The most simple function and in my opinion the most useful function is the `print()` statement. This function
is extremely useful for debugging code and checking variable values. To print something in Python 3, just write the following and
run the cell by pressing `Shift+Enter`:

print("Hello World")

You could use single quotation marks and do:

print('Hello World')

Single quotation marks do pretty much everything double quotation marks do. Double quotation marks are usually preferred as they can handle apostrophes in strings. For example:

print("Hello! I'm a cat!")

```{warning}
This would not work with single quotation marks!
```

print('Hello! I'm a cat!')

>I have a habit of using single quotation marks since I am lazy and don't like pressing two keys so you might see many uses of single quotation marks. At the end of the day, there's not much difference between the two besides allowing for apostrophes in strings.
