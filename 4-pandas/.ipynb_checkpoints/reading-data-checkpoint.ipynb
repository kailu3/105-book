Most of the time in this class, we'll be reading in data from `.csv` (comma-separated values) files which we can think of as tablular data in Excel. If you've ever worked with Excel, you would definitely have worked with `.csv` files. To start off, we first need to import `pandas` to use build-in functions that will allow us to read in these `.csv` files."
