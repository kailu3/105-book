# Introduction to Pandas

`pandas` is library/package built for doing flexible and easy data analysis in Python. The data structure `pandas` uses to store data is called a `DataFrame` which can be simply thought as a table that has rows and columns. To use pandas, we typically import it with alias `pandas`.

```
import pandas as pd
```

[Python for Data Analysis](https://bedford-computing.co.uk/learning/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Python-for-Data-Analysis.pdf) is a great resource for learning more about pandas from the author of pandas, Wes McKinney.
