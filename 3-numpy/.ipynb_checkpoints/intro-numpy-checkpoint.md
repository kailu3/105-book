# Introduction to NumPy

NumPy (pronounced "num-pie") is a Python library we will be using to deal with numbers and arrays of numbers. To use NumPy, we typically import it with alias `np`.

```
import numpy as np
```

`numpy` is frequently used for numerical computation (e.g. numerical analysis, matrix computations).
