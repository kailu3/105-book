# Introduction to Jupyter

For all of this book, we will be working in Jupyter Notebooks, which is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text. I think of Jupyter Notebooks as the perfect medium for doing and sharing exploratory data analysis work. Notebooks are the ideal sandbox for playing around with new ideas and tools.

## Creating Your First Jupyter Notebook

Depending on how you installed Jupyter, there are several ways to open up a Jupyter Notebook. One of them is through the **Anaconda Navigator** if you installed through Anaconda.

Open the Anaconda Navigator and launch the Notebook from there.


```{figure} ../img/0-anaconda.png
---
name: anaconda
---

```


You can also open up the **Terminal** and run the command

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

You would now want to navigate to (or create) some folder where you would like to create your Notebook in.


```{figure} ../img/0-jupyter.png
---
name: Jupyter
---

```

You can create a **Notebook** from the right dropdown by selecting Python 3.

## JupyterLab

The Jupyter team recently (2018) created a newer user interface that offers all the familiar building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook (notebook, terminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs, etc) in a more flexible and powerful interface. The project is called **JupyterLab** and essentially provides everything Jupyter Notebooks has but better (my opinion).

```{note}
JupyterLab is not needed for CIS 105, but it's good to know that this exists.
```

If you go back to the main interface of Anaconda Navigator, JupyterLab is the first option from the top-left.

```{tip}
I personally use Jupyterlab as being able to have tabs of notebooks and also being able to split screen between multiple notebooks are luxuries I can't give up.
```
