# Preface

This is a book documenting the topics taught in CIS 105: Computational Data Exploration. For the most part, the content will closely follow the course content and may in some areas expand on it. The goal for this book is to provide a reference guide for the material taught in 105.

## Who Is This Book For?

For students in CIS 105 and also anyone looking for an easy introduction to learn Python for data analysis. Over the past
months, I've received a lot of questions about how to best learn Python for data analysis from **scratch** as a lot of the
introductory resources out there seem to assume some computer science knowledge which can be daunting for some.
My other goal for this book is to provide an easy-to-reference guide for anyone looking to dabble in Python and teach
the data science process from how I would've wanted to learn it if I could go back in time. 

```{warning}
More advanced or experienced users will find the pacing to be slow. I would recommend checking out [*The Python Data Science Handbook*](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) by Jake VanderPlas as a faster introduction to learn Python for data analysis.
```

## Getting Help

While I would love to help everyone, time can be constraining. Usually, my advice is to Google it first and try to figure it out yourself. There is a great quote from **Jake VanderPlas** on this:

> Being an effective practitioner of data science is less about memorizing the tool or command you should use for every possible situation, and more about learning to effectively find the information you don't know, whether through a web search engine or another means.
